# mace_batch_inference

This is an example of how a typical architecture for machine learning batch inference code would look like. Currently for demonstration purposes, the uma_parallel.py is a workable “single-file pipeline” script (POSCAR parsing → layer grouping → permutation generation → multiprocessing fan-out → GPU inference → screening → DB write). No modularization was implemented for simplicity sake. Uses UMA-S-1p1 (MD5 checksum = 36a2f071350be0ee4c15e7ebdd16dde1) as the pre-trained foundation model without any fine-tuning conducted (https://huggingface.co/facebook/UMA). Added also analyze_uma_db.py to showscase how to extract and analyze relevant information from the stored *.db files.
